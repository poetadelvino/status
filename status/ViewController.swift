/*  said in class by James:

ModelViewController

M.... is for Model
V.... is a view, very dum
C....   controller

a Model can be a User.  another kind of model is: Status

today we'll focus on the Model.   a model layer
every app has a model.

the famous one is the user model, or user class





we could have given this a better name, like StatusViewController
